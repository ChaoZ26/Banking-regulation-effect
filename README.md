# Banking-regulation-effect
This project is to estimate the announcement effect of Volcker Rule (new banking  regulation in US) on US banks
More specifically, analyze:

(i) Did the banks decrease their trading assets after the announcement of the new regulation?

(ii) If they responded to the regulation, which banks responded most and which banks least? 
Why?

(iii) Remember robustness, and how should banks or regulators use these results?

The data is in DiD_data.csv, general report is Final Report.pdf. Codes and appendix are also attached.
